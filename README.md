ANN can be used for both Regression and Classification problems. In this section, we will be using a Customer Churn dataset and build an ANN Classification Model.  The dataset 'Churn_Modelling.csv' is sourced from Kaggle. It has 10,000 rows and 14 columns. The column of interest is 'Exited' which has values 0 or 1.
